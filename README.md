# Crypto-project
Little project in java to better understand the prime number and cryptographic algorithme to find the factorization of a number by 2 prime number.
You can :
- create your RSA key with your prime number
- encrypt a message with a RSA key
- decrypt a message with a RSA key
- find the decomposition of a number in 2 other numbers. find m and n that k= m*n. It's usefull because a key is a math√©matical product between 2 prime number
- find the k next prime number of an integer

I didn't put yet :
- discret logarithm method
- elliptic curve method
- quadratic screen method

All the comments are in french and it's not very well commented, sorry !
